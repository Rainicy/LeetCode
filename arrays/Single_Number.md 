## Single Number 

### Description
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] A) {
        
        // Using sort and go through the whole array
        Arrays.sort(A);
        
        for (int i=0; i<A.length-1; i+=2) {
            if (A[i] != A[i+1]) {
                return A[i];
            }
        }
        return A[A.length-1];
    }
}
```
